I'm a web developer who focuses primarily on WordPress theme and plugin development and site management. You can find my professional work, and reach out if you want to work with me, over at [Tenseg LLC](https://www.tenseg.net). Being that I work with WordPress, the primary lanaguages I deal with are:

* PHP
* Javascript/Typescript
* (S)CSS
* HTML

Some of the work I've done involves React, both for Gutenberg blocks and beyond. I have extensive experience with plugin and theme development, including the use of the WP REST API and WP CLI.

I also know some Swift from a little bit of iOS app development, and have dabbled in many other languages as any given project necesitates.
